# Portfolio Performance Analyser

Background Storyline: Harold's company has been investing in algorithmic trading strategies. Some of the investment managers love them, some hate them, but they all think their way is best.

You know these quantitative analysis techniques with Python and Pandas, so Harold has come to you with a challengeâ€”to help him determine which portfolio is performing the best across multiple areas: volatility, returns, risk, and Sharpe ratios.

To that goal, I have created a tool (an analysis notebook) that analyzes and visualizes the major metrics of the portfolios across all of these areas, and determines which portfolio outperformed the others. I have used the historical daily returns of several portfolios: some from the firm's algorithmic portfolios, some that represent the portfolios of famous "whale" investors like Warren Buffett, and some from the big hedge and mutual funds. I have then used this analysis to create a custom portfolio of stocks and compare its performance to that of the other portfolios, as well as the larger market (S&P 500 Index).
